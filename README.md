# Password Strength Checker Using NLP🔑

## Introduction
Every time you attempt to sign up on a website by creating an ID and password, you'll encounter a set of requirements for the password. An automated program then checks whether the entered password meets these criteria and determines its strength. In this context, I have developed a machine learning model using NLP (Natural Language Processing) algorithms to categorize user passwords into three distinct categories
## Goal

**Objective:** Develop a Machine Learning model using NLP algorithm to classify user's password into three categories: Weak, Medium, or Strong.

## Python Libraries Utilized
This project employs a variety of Python libraries, each serving a specific role in data processing and model development:

- **Pandas & Numpy:** For efficient data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Sklearn:** For implementing and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Seaborn:** simplifiying the process of creating complex visualizations and integrates well with Pandas data structures.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization and graphical representation of insights.

## Model Accuracy
The following screenshot highlights the accuracy of a predictive model. These metrics are crucial in understanding the performance and reliability of our solution:
